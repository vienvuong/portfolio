## Introduction

I find it annoying to have to log into Hackernews and Reddit separately every morning. So I created an all-in-one news aggregation site for both websites that allows me save my favorite articles.

## Features

- Aggregate posts from Hackernews and Reddit using their public APIs
- Sort by Best, Top, New
- See your saved favorite posts (for either Hackernews or Reddit)
- Search by keyword, filter search by time frame (Hour, Day, All Time, etc.)
